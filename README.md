# Lending Club Case Study
The objective is to analyze loan data to uncover patterns in loan issuance and identify potential business insights that can drive strategic decision-making.
A large online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans,  wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. 

The aim of the case study is to identify applicants who are likely to default using EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis).

## General Information
- Aim: The aim of the case study is to identify applicants who are likely to default using EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis). A Data-Driven Approach to Understanding Loan Issuance Trends
- Background: This project addresses the critical issue of credit loss faced by lending companies, particularly in the context of an online loan marketplace that facilitates personal loans, business loans, and financing for medical procedures. Credit loss arises when borrowers, labeled as 'charged-off,' default on their loans, resulting in significant financial losses for lenders. By identifying risky loan applicants, lenders can reduce the incidence of defaults and, consequently, their credit losses.

In this study, we aim to leverage Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover the driving factors behind loan defaults. Understanding the variables that indicate a higher likelihood of default will enable the company to enhance its portfolio management and risk assessment strategies. By analyzing various attributes of loan applicants, we seek to pinpoint strong indicators of default and provide actionable insights that can inform lending decisions.

To ensure a comprehensive understanding of the domain, we have conducted independent research on risk analytics, focusing on the types of variables involved and their significance in predicting loan defaults. This foundational knowledge will guide our analysis and help in developing models that effectively identify potential defaulters.

- The data given contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

## Conclusions
- In this examination of Lending Club loan data, our objective was to uncover the primary factors impacting loan defaults through a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- The univariate and segmented univariate analyses indicated that variables like loan amount, interest rate, employment length, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio are significant predictors of loan defaults. 
- The bivariate analysis, which integrated these insights, reinforced our conclusions, showing that higher-risk borrowers often secured larger loans with elevated interest rates, coupled with shorter employment histories or greater financial obligations.
